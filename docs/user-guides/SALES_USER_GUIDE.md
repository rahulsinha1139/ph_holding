2. Review RFQs by year, stage, and search.
3. Update notes and create tasks for follow-up.
4. Prepare costing for qualified opportunities.
5. Save approved costing as an offer.
6. Export/send quotation PDF.
7. Schedule follow-ups.
8. Mark offers won/lost.
9. Create or review customer orders after a win.
