## Role Model

Production access is license-key driven. License prefixes map to roles:

| Prefix | Role | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| `PH-ADM-*` | Admin | Full system access |
| `PH-MGR-*` | Manager | Commercial, operations, finance, HR/work visibility, approvals |
| `PH-SLS-*` | Sales | RFQ, costing, offers, orders, customers, supplier lookup, limited PO creation |
| `PH-OPS-*` | Operations | Supplier, PO, supplier invoice, delivery, order fulfillment, OCR |
| `PH-STF-*` | Staff | Dashboard, work, tasks, notifications |
| `PH-DEV-MASTER` | Developer/admin master key | Controlled developer support key when enabled |

If a user cannot see a screen, the screen is hidden by permission filtering rather than shown as disabled. That is expected behavior.

## Standard Workflow

The core trading workflow is:

1. Create or import an RFQ/opportunity.
2. Prepare costing against the opportunity.
3. Save the costing as an offer and export the quotation PDF.
4. Mark the offer won when the customer PO arrives.
5. Convert or create the customer order.
6. Create supplier orders as needed.
7. Receive and check supplier invoice data.
8. Create delivery note and dispatch/confirm delivery.
9. Create/send customer invoice.
10. Record customer payment and reconcile the bank statement.
