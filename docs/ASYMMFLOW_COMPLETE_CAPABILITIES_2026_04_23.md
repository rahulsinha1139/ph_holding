# AsymmFlow Complete Capability Profile

Source-grounded marketing document  
Prepared: 23 April 2026

## Executive Positioning

AsymmFlow is an offline-first ERP and operating intelligence platform for trading, engineering supply, procurement, delivery, finance, and management teams. It brings the commercial pipeline, costing, quotations, customer orders, procurement, supplier invoices, delivery notes, invoicing, banking, payroll, expenses, tasks, people operations, OCR capture, and AI-assisted business intelligence into one desktop application.

The product is designed around a local operating database, so daily business work can continue even when the internet is unavailable. Optional cloud sync, OCR, and AI services extend the system when connectivity and credentials are configured, but the core ERP workflows remain anchored in the local application.

AsymmFlow is not just a record-keeping tool. It is built to preserve the operating memory of a company: customers, suppliers, quotations, commercial terms, delivery commitments, payment behavior, employee work, document evidence, and the context behind decisions.

## Scope And Claim Discipline

This document is based on the AsymmFlow codebase and local database inspected on 23 April 2026. It is intentionally written as a professional marketing and capability profile, while avoiding claims that are not supported by the application.

Capability labels used in this document:

| Label | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Primary workflow | Visible in the current hub or screen structure and intended for regular user operation. |
| Service-backed capability | Implemented in backend services and/or secondary screens, even if not always foregrounded in the main hub tabs. |
| Optional integration | Available when external credentials, cloud services, or deployment configuration are present. |

Accuracy guardrails:

- Core ERP operations are local and offline-first.
- Cloud sync requires configured Supabase credentials and network access.
- AI assistance requires configured model credentials and network access.
- OCR can use local extraction for supported digital documents, while scanned and image-heavy workflows may use configured vision or remote OCR services.
- AI and OCR outputs support review, capture, and workflow acceleration. They should not be marketed as autonomous decision-making.
- Some service-backed modules may be in controlled rollout or secondary navigation even though the underlying capability exists.

### Practical Offline Message

The safest external positioning is:

> AsymmFlow keeps the operating ERP database local so users can keep working without internet. When cloud credentials and connectivity are available, the system can synchronize data across devices and use AI or OCR services to accelerate document capture and analysis.

This statement is stronger and more accurate than saying every feature is fully offline, because cloud sync and external AI services depend on network access.

## Professional Marketing Language

The following language is safe to reuse in brochures, proposals, and client presentations.

### Short Description

AsymmFlow is an offline-first ERP and business intelligence workspace for trading and engineering supply companies. It connects sales, costing, procurement, delivery, invoicing, banking, payroll, expenses, task management, customer relationships, OCR capture, and AI-assisted operational intelligence in one desktop application.

### Operational Description

AsymmFlow is designed for companies that need more than accounting software and more discipline than spreadsheets. It tracks the full operating chain from RFQ to quotation, order, supplier procurement, receiving, delivery, invoicing, payment, reconciliation, and management reporting. The system keeps the local business database available on the desktop, with optional cloud synchronization and AI services when configured.

### Intelligence Description

The Butler intelligence layer helps users ask operational questions, analyze documents, prepare reports, and move from insight to action. It uses AsymmFlow business context such as customers, suppliers, invoices, payments, offers, tasks, delivery commitments, and risk indicators, while respecting user permissions and keeping review steps in the workflow.

### OCR Description

AsymmFlow can capture business documents from PDFs, images, spreadsheets, Word files, and email formats, extract key fields, classify document types, and route reviewed data into RFQs, invoices, supplier invoices, purchase orders, delivery notes, bank statements, and document evidence records.

### Offline-First Description

AsymmFlow is built around a local operating database so users can continue core ERP work without depending on an always-on internet connection. Optional cloud sync, AI, and OCR services can be enabled where connectivity and credentials are available.

### Security Description

AsymmFlow combines role-based access, device-bound licensing, permission-filtered navigation, guarded backend endpoints, audit trails, delete approvals, and deployment readiness tools to keep operational control inside the system.

## Claim-Safe Sales Notes

Use these points when positioning the product:

- Say "offline-first" rather than "every feature works offline."
- Say "AI-assisted" rather than "fully autonomous."
- Say "structured OCR capture with review" rather than "perfect OCR."
- Say "optional cloud synchronization" rather than "cloud-dependent."
- Say "role-based access across backend and navigation" rather than "security by UI only."
- Say "service-backed modules exist for cheque register, book-bank reconciliation, FX revaluation, inventory, GRN, serial traceability, expenses, and payroll" if the sales conversation needs to distinguish currently foregrounded tabs from deeper product capability.
- Say "the current dataset demonstrates real operating depth" rather than promising a fixed number of records in every deployment.

## Capability Summary

AsymmFlow has the breadth of an ERP, the practical workflow depth of a trading operations system, and the intelligence layer of a modern document-aware business workspace. Its strongest product story is not a single feature. It is the fact that commercial, finance, procurement, delivery, people, documents, tasks, and AI context are connected in the same application.

The application can be positioned professionally as:

> An offline-first ERP and operating intelligence platform that helps trading and engineering supply teams manage the full business cycle from inquiry to cash, procurement to delivery, and document capture to management insight.
