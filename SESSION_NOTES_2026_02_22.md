# Session Notes — 2026-02-22

## What Was Done

### Phase 21: Delivery Fulfillment & Partial Invoicing
Implemented the end-to-end Order -> Deliver -> Invoice pipeline for partial deliveries.

**4 gaps closed:**
1. **OrderItem quantities update on delivery** — `QuantityShipped` updated in `CreateDNFromOrder`, `QuantityDelivered` updated in `ConfirmDeliveryNote`, both using atomic SQL increments
2. **DN-based partial invoicing** — invoices use delivered quantities from DN items, not full order quantities. `CreateInvoiceFromDN(deliveryNoteID)` wrapper added. VAT calculated from invoice subtotal for partial invoices.
3. **Invoiceable quantity validation** — when order has DNs, can only invoice delivered-but-not-yet-invoiced quantities. Error returned when nothing to invoice.
4. **ProgressOrderOnInvoice partial awareness** — sets "PartiallyInvoiced" when not all items fully invoiced, "Invoiced" when complete.

### Full Inventory/Stock/Warehouse Code Removal
PH Trading is buy-to-order (process instrumentation, made-to-order). No stock is kept. Removed all inventory-related code:

- **Deleted**: `inventory_service.go` (336 lines)
- **Removed from `app.go`**: 12 API functions (~480 lines) — GetInventoryItems, GetInventoryItem, CreateInventoryItem, UpdateInventoryItem, RecordStockMovement, calculateStockStatus, GetStockMovements, CreateStockAdjustment, ApproveStockAdjustment, GetLowStockItems, GetInventoryValuation, GetWarehouses, CreateWarehouse
- **Removed from `database.go`**: 4 struct types — InventoryItem, StockMovement, StockAdjustment, Warehouse
- **Removed from `reports.go` / `report_generators.go`**: inventory report functions, StockMovementSummary, getInventoryReport
- **Cleaned `tally_importer.go`**: Balance sheet inventory = 0 (was summing empty InventoryItem table)
- **Frontend cleaned**: mocks, types, ReportsScreen, ShowcaseScreen, DashboardScreen, FinancialDashboard

**Database tables left dormant**: `inventory_items`, `stock_movements`, `stock_adjustments`, `warehouses` — empty and harmless, no migration needed.
