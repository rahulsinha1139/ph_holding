# Security Fixes Applied - February 16, 2026

## Overview

Three critical security vulnerabilities have been fixed in the PH Holdings Sovereign UI codebase to enhance the application's security posture and prevent potential exploits.

---

## FIX 1: RBAC Startup Bypass Timeout

### Vulnerability
The `startupImporting` flag was designed to bypass RBAC checks during data import operations. However, if the import process hung or crashed, the flag could remain `true` indefinitely, leaving RBAC disabled permanently.

### Impact
**Severity**: HIGH
**Attack Vector**: A malicious user could exploit a hung import process to gain unrestricted access to all system operations without proper permission checks.

### Fix Applied

#### Changes to `app.go`:

1. **Added `startupImportStartTime` field to App struct** (Line 65):
```go
startupImporting      bool      // Bypass RBAC during startup data import
startupImportStartTime time.Time // Timestamp when startup import began (for timeout enforcement)
```

2. **Set timestamp when import starts** (Line 817):
```go
a.startupImporting = true
a.startupImportStartTime = time.Now() // Record when RBAC bypass started
```

3. **Enforce 5-minute timeout in `requirePermission`** (Lines 11404-11412):
```go
if a.startupImporting {
    // FIX 1: Enforce timeout to prevent indefinite RBAC bypass
    if time.Since(a.startupImportStartTime) > 5*time.Minute {
        a.startupImporting = false
        log.Println("⚠️ WARNING: Startup import timeout exceeded (5 min), re-enabling RBAC for security")
    } else {
        return nil // Still within safe window, allow bypass
    }
}
```

### Result
- RBAC bypass is now strictly limited to 5 minutes maximum
- After timeout, RBAC is automatically re-enabled even if import is still running
- Protection against hung processes or malicious exploitation
- Logged warning when timeout triggers for audit purposes

## FIX 2: Enhanced RBAC Permission Matching

### Vulnerability
The RBAC permission system had incomplete category-level permission matching. When a role had "finance" permission, it wasn't properly granting access to granular permissions like "finance:view", "finance:create", etc.

### Impact
**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Issue**: Roles with category-level permissions (like "finance" or "operations") might not properly grant access to specific operations, leading to either overly permissive workarounds or blocked legitimate access.

### Fix Applied

#### Enhanced Permission Checking in `app.go` (Lines 11470-11490):

```go
// Check if user has the required permission
// FIX 2: Enhanced permission matching with category-level support
for _, p := range permissions {
    if p == permission || p == "*" {
        return nil // Permission granted (exact match or wildcard)
    }
    // Check wildcard patterns like "customers:*" matching "customers:view"
    if strings.HasSuffix(p, ":*") {
        prefix := strings.TrimSuffix(p, "*")
        if strings.HasPrefix(permission, prefix) {
            return nil // Wildcard match
        }
    }
    // Check category-level permissions: "finance" grants "finance:view", "finance:create", etc.
    if strings.Contains(permission, ":") {
        category := strings.Split(permission, ":")[0]
        if p == category {
            return nil // Category-level permission granted
        }
    }
}
```

### Permission Hierarchy Now Supported

| Role Permission | Grants Access To |
|----------------|------------------|
| `"*"` | All operations (admin wildcard) |
| `"finance"` | `finance:view`, `finance:create`, `finance:delete`, etc. |
| `"finance:*"` | All finance operations (explicit wildcard) |
| `"finance:view"` | Only `finance:view` (granular) |

### Result
- Category-level permissions (e.g., "finance") now properly grant all sub-permissions
- Manager role with "finance" permission can now access bank accounts, reconciliation, etc.
- Sales and Operations roles without "finance" permission remain blocked from financial data
- Backward compatible with existing permission strings

---

## FIX 3: Error Sanitization for Database Initialization

### Vulnerability
When the database connection failed during initialization, the error message exposed the full internal file path to the user via a dialog box.

### Impact
**Severity**: LOW
**Attack Vector**: Path disclosure could aid attackers in understanding the application's directory structure, making targeted attacks easier.

### Example of Exposed Information
```
Failed to connect to SQLite database: unable to open database file: C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Local\ph_holdings\ph_holdings.db: permission denied
```

### Fix Applied

#### Sanitized Error Messages in `app.go` (Lines 318-335):

**Before:**
```go
errMsg := fmt.Sprintf("Failed to connect to SQLite database: %v", err)
runtime.MessageDialog(ctx, runtime.MessageDialogOptions{
    Type:    runtime.ErrorDialog,
    Title:   "Database Connection Error",
    Message: errMsg, // Exposed internal paths and error details
})
```

**After:**
```go
// FIX 3: Sanitize error message - don't expose internal paths to user
sanitizedMsg := "Failed to connect to database. Please check your installation and ensure the application has proper file permissions."

// Log detailed error internally for debugging
AppLogger.Error("Database connection failed", err, map[string]interface{}{
    "path": dbPath,
})

if ctx != nil {
    runtime.MessageDialog(ctx, runtime.MessageDialogOptions{
        Type:    runtime.ErrorDialog,
        Title:   "Database Connection Error",
        Message: sanitizedMsg, // User sees sanitized message only
    })
} else {
    // Fallback: Write sanitized message to stderr
    fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "FATAL DATABASE ERROR: %s\n", sanitizedMsg)
}
```

### Result
- Users see a generic, helpful error message
- Internal details (paths, specific errors) are logged for debugging but not exposed to UI
- Attackers cannot gather information about application structure from error messages
- Maintains user experience while improving security posture

## Verification & Testing

### Test Cases to Run

1. **RBAC Timeout Test**:
   ```go
   // Simulate hung import
   app.startupImporting = true
   app.startupImportStartTime = time.Now().Add(-6 * time.Minute)

   // Attempt protected operation
   err := app.requirePermission("finance:delete")
   // Expected: Permission denied (RBAC re-enabled after 5 min)
   ```

2. **Category Permission Test**:
   ```go
   // User with "finance" permission
   err := app.requirePermission("finance:view")    // Should succeed
   err := app.requirePermission("finance:create")  // Should succeed
   err := app.requirePermission("customers:view")  // Should fail (no customer permission)
   ```

3. **Error Sanitization Test**:
   ```bash
   # Make database inaccessible
   chmod 000 ph_holdings.db

   # Start app
   # Expected: Dialog shows generic message, not file path
   # Log file contains detailed error with path
   ```

## Files Modified

1. `app.go`:
   - Line 65: Added `startupImportStartTime` field
   - Line 817: Set timestamp when import starts
   - Lines 11404-11412: Timeout enforcement in `requirePermission`

---

## Deployment Notes

### No Breaking Changes
- All fixes are backward compatible
- Existing permission strings work as before
- No database schema changes required
- No UI changes required

### Recommended Actions After Deployment

1. **Monitor logs** for RBAC timeout warnings:
   ```
   ⚠️ WARNING: Startup import timeout exceeded (5 min), re-enabling RBAC for security
   ```

2. **Review role permissions**:
   - Ensure "finance" permission is only on admin/manager roles
   - Verify sales/operations roles don't have inadvertent finance access

3. **Test critical flows**:
   - Bank reconciliation (finance:view required)
   - Payment recording (payments:create required)
   - Customer invoice access (invoices:view required)

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **Granular Ownership Checks**:
   - Add customer assignment tracking per user
   - Scope financial data access to assigned customers only
   - Implement data-level RBAC (currently role-level only)

2. **Audit Logging Enhancement**:
   - Log all permission denials with context
   - Track RBAC bypass events during startup
   - Alert on suspicious permission patterns

3. **Permission Management UI**:
   - Admin screen to view/edit role permissions
   - Visual permission matrix showing role capabilities
   - Test mode to verify user permissions before applying
